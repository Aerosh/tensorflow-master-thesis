Datasets
---------
1. ImageNet
2. CIFAR
3. MNIST

Evaluations
--------------
*1. Top-1 and top-5 accuracy on the validation set versus alpha.
*2. Number of kernels versus layer number at convergence for various alphas.
*3. Layer sparsity versus iteration number for sample alpha, and multiple layers, using a stacked area plot.
*4. Complexity (theoretical, i.e., num. of FLOPS) vs. top-X accuracy.
*5. Alpha vs. top-X accuracy.
*6. Alpha vs. complexity (number of multiply-adds).
7. Visualize filters vs. alpha (first layer is easy to do).
8. Visualize square filters versus iteration number.
9. Visualize filter "confusion matrix" based on correlations vs. alpha, for various layers.

Architectures
--------------
1. Resnet, 7-layer.
2. CNN (w/o residual units), 7-layer.
3. A bigger architeture to attempt to achieve SOTA.

Regularization schemes
-----------------------
1. Kernel-based.
2. Ring-based (How do we visualize sparsity vs. iters???).
3. Rectangular-kernel-based
4. Rectangular-kernel-based + feature-map based.
**5. Comparison against l2-regularized case (weight decay).

Questions to answer experimentally
-------------------------------------------------
(Need futher experiments)- Does zeroing the 1% kernels affect the performance?
*- Histogram of kernel norms for a given layer (is it bi-modal?).
- State-of-the-art results: Can we achieve them or outperform them?

Other things
------------
- Increased learning speed by dropping near-zero kernels
*- New measure of approx sparsity (for case when all kernels are zero).
*- Accessing weights?
- MNIST
- Visualization - which weights disappear versus alpha?


Current
------
- New regularization schemes - change l_1(s_ij) regularizer by l_1(s_ij)^2
	- Learn on cifar 10 resnet-20.
- Is convexity an issue? Multiple runs for same alpha, does complexity change a lot?

- ImageNet complexity-accuracy plots.

- Fixing complexity code - I should have a look!
- Validation on ImageNet (ResNet 18) + complexity.
 
- Feature size vs. performance on transfer learning (e.g., Pascal VOC).
