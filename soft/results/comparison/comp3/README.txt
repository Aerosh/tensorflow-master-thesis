An interesting behaviour we can observe is the increase on accuracy, but also in term of accuracy.
It suggest that networks with more parameters needs a smaller learning step to achieve nearly similar results than smaller architecture. However, even if we can reach similar accuracy, we are still unable to have an accuracy similar enough to the classic resnet10.
