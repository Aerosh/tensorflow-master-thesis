Comparison between two resnet10-square-10 mnist CNN.
A first remark is a small difference in results between them in terms of complexity and accuracy.
However, both of them perform poorly compare similar construction under similar penalization.
A possible factor expaining this difference would be the learning rate difference, nearly ten times bigger than other results.
In the second comparison, we will see the impact in both complexity, sparsity and accuracy with lower learning rate.
